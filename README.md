# Fake News Detection

This repo is a small Flask webapp build around the model I trained in (this kaggle notebook)[https://www.kaggle.com/code/liamgeron/99-9-accurate-news-classification-with-bert]. I was able to achieve > 99.9% accuracy with it using BERT, so I decided to put it online so others can play around with it.

If you enjoy it, please support me by starring the repo and/or upvoting the notebook in kaggle!
